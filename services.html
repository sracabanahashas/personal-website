    <p>Sometimes people ask me for help with projects. 
        Here are some of my skills.</p>

    <h2>Writing</h2>

    <p>I've handled written communications for event companies, retailers,
        arts organizations, technology companies, law firms and a lot of other
        things I'm forgetting. I probably have experience writing things similar
        to what you need. If I like your project, I'll study up to fill 
        in any gaps.
    </p>

    <h2>Music Production</h2>

    <p>My compositions have been performed by orchestral ensembles and concert
        pianists, I've mixed on award-winning records, and I've shared the stage
        with beloved artists including Chaz Bear (Toro y Moi), Bill Orcutt, Lonnie Holley
        and Colloboh. 
    </p>

    <p>I'm particularly interested in projects and organizations that have a community-building
        mission, or that envision a more equitable, just and sustainable 
        society.
