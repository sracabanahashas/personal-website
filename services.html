    <p>Sometimes people ask me for help with projects. 
        Here are some of my skills.</p>

    <h2>Writing</h2>

    <p>I've handled written communications for event companies, retailers,
        arts organizations, technology companies, law firms and a lot of other
        things I'm forgetting. I probably have experience writing things similar
        to what you need. If I take on your project, I'll study up to fill 
        in any gaps.
    </p>

    <p>I'm particularly interested in working with organizations that have a community-building
        mission, or that envision a more equitable, just and sustainable 
        society.
    </p>

    <h2>Music</h2>

    <p>My compositions have been performed by orchestral ensembles and concert
        pianists, I've mixed on award-winning records, and I've shared the stage
        with beloved artists including Chaz Bear (Toro y Moi), Bill Orcutt, Lonnie Holley
        and Colloboh. 
    </p>

    <p>I have an electronic music project called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/fieldsfields">FIELDS.</a> 
        It's inspired by house, techno, chiptunes and video game soundtracks. I'm open to 
        licensing and commissions for your video game or film score.
    </p>

    <h2>Web Development</h2>

    <p>I can code a basic website from scratch (like the one you're reading, for example). I've also 
        set up and managed fancy-looking Wordpress sites for clients with 
        various needs in the arts, automotive, mental health and executive coaching spaces.
