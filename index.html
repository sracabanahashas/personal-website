    <h1>Welcome.</h1>

    <p>This is my personal website. Thanks for visiting. I hope you enjoy your time here.</p>

    <h2>Who am I and what do I do?</h2>

    <p>I'm into learning and creating. Sometimes I write. Sometimes I make music. Sometimes...</p>

    <h2>What things have I done?</h2>

    <p>I've been an English teacher, an event producer, a composer, a
        bartender, a copywriter, a performer, a bodyguard for Kevin Bacon (true story),
        a sound engineer, and many other things. I'm a co-founding partner at 
        <a href="https://www.workingnamestudios.space">Working Name Studios</a>, where I manage communications. 
    </p>

    <h2>What do I want out of life?</h2>

    <p>Knowledge and adventure, and to leave things better than I found them.</p>

    <h2>Why did I make this website?</h3>

    <p>So when people ask to see my website, I can show them 
        something that will help them understand who I am.
    </p>

    <h2>Who is this for?</h2>

    <p>Mostly me, but I will share it with you.</p>

    <h2>What can I do for you?</h2>

    <p>That really depends on you and what you want to accomplish. I offer certain 
        <a href="services.html">services,</a>
        and am always interested in hearing about new projects.
